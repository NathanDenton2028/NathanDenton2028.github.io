          <p>
            Mechanical engineering student at Northeastern University (Class of
            2028) pursuing a robotics minor. With a 3.9 GPA and Dean’s List
            recognition, I blend mechanical design, CAD modelling and
            integrated hardware/software systems to build thoughtful solutions.
            I thrive on hands‑on projects—from managing a wind‑turbine exhibit
            for children to designing a robotic hand input device—and I enjoy
            leading teams to turn ideas into reality. My studies abroad in
            Dublin strengthened my adaptability and collaboration skills, and
            I’m passionate about sustainable technology and robotics.

            <h3>Interactive Wind Turbine Exhibit</h3>
            <p class="summary">
              Designed and built an interactive wind‑energy exhibit where two
              players assemble custom turbines and compete to generate the
              highest power output. The game teaches children aged 6–11
              about renewable energy through hands‑on play.

                In my Cornerstone of Engineering project, our four‑person team
                developed <em>Turbine Trials</em>: a portable exhibit that
                challenges young visitors to choose blades, motors and bases
                and then see whose turbine generates the most energy. We used
                Arduino microcontrollers to read colour‑coded button inputs
                and relay them to MATLAB, which calculated simulated power
                output and displayed scores on LCD screens. The exhibit
                included educational boards tailored to different age groups
                explaining how wind energy works and why renewable sources are
                important.
              </p>
              <p>
                As team manager, I oversaw the schedule and made major
                contributions to both mechanical and software design. I
                modelled the enclosure, centre components and rotating
                display in SolidWorks, designed laser‑cut panels and our
                custom button assembly, and built the roller system and
                mounting brackets for the trifold display. I also constructed
                the mounting system for the turbines, drilled holes and
                installed magnets in the 3D‑printed pieces, and wired two
                Arduino boards to integrate all electronics. On the software
                side I wrote the Arduino scripts that gather player inputs
                and drive the LCD displays, as well as the MATLAB code that
                ranks players and computes energy generation. This project
                honed my ability to blend CAD, fabrication, electronics and
                programming into a cohesive user experience.

            <p class="summary">
              An ongoing research project to develop a wearable glove that
              maps human hand movements to a robotic hand using encoders and
              motion sensors. The device allows intuitive teleoperation of an
              actuated hand.

                As part of Northeastern’s robotic arm project I’m leading the
                design of a hand input device that lets users control a
                robotic hand by simply moving their own. The system focuses
                on the knuckle and middle joints of each finger and uses
                miniature rotary encoders to measure flexion while ignoring
                lateral motion. A 9‑DOF inertial measurement unit (IMU) on
                the thumb captures its unique range of motion. All sensors
                will be integrated into a comfortable glove.
              </p>
              <p>
                I’m currently researching existing DIY input gloves and
                capturing concepts from hobbyist projects to inform my
                design. Early SolidWorks models explore how to mount
                encoders on the glove without inhibiting movement, and I’m
                prototyping brackets that can be 3D printed or laser‑cut for
                quick iteration. Once the mechanical layout is finalized,
                microcontroller firmware will translate encoder readings into
                commands for the robotic hand. This project is still in
                development, leaving room for future improvements and
                additional sensing capabilities.

              As a mechanical engineer on Northeastern’s MATE robotics team, I
              focused on wiring and waterproofing key electrical components
              to ensure reliability. Using SolidWorks and PDM, I integrated
              legacy CAD designs into the current robot and designed an
              additional bottom claw to expand its capabilities.
